leo wants to give players option to type their real name, instead of Scratch

show X/O first, then alert

when someone wins/loses win/lose screen shows up
with restart button

when win screen shows up a replay of
the player playing shows and animates





Done:
Alert winner with the name

typograph and font for "X" and "O"

After someone wins, game stops
