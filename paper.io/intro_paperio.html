        <h3>
            Paper io is a game where you are a block of any skin
            <br>
            and you run around the map filling more spaces as you go.
            <br>
            don't get killed! you get killed by someone touching your line
            <br>
            if you touch your own line you get killed too
            <br>
            you can also touch other people's lines to get them killed.
            <br>
            to win you have to cover the whole map.
            <br>
            the block follows your mouse or whatever your on like ipad and yeah.
            <br>
